<p>O time de Design da <a href="https://bocoup.com/">Bocoup</a> mantém o Open Design Kit como uma ferramenta open source. Ela e feita para colaboradores não presenciais, de vários níveis de experiência. Nenhuma experiência anterior em design é necessária para você tentar algum desses métodos, apenas uma mente aberta. O Kit inclui atividades desde a idealização até a implementação e pode evoluir através de seu uso. Para compartilhar o seu feedback ou adicionar um novo método, abra uma issue ou um pull request no nosso repositório no GitHub.</p>
<p>Each method of the kit is designed with distributed teams in mind. We did this because we believe that diverse products require diverse teams. To make a diverse team, you can’t rely on having that collaborator in the same room as you – let alone neighborhood or country! The methods here leverage digital tools such as chat, note-taking documents and screen sharing software to take advantage of the connected world that we live in.</p>
<p>We believe that the world needs this design kit to:</p>
<ul>
    <li>establish what it means to design in the open, with practical methods designed for distributed collaborators.</li>
    <li>provide a framework for design thinking and conversations within open source development.</li>
    <li>share open educational resources to support design literacy</li>
</ul>
<p>This exploration was inspired by many individuals and organizations. A few projects that do a great job at identifying design tools and practices are <a href="http://www.designkit.org/">Ideo's HCD Design Kit</a>, <a href="https://methods.18f.gov/">18F's Methods</a>, and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/design-principles">Gov.uk Design Principles</a>. The goal of this kit is not to replace these resources, but to live beside them.</p>
<p>Since 2009, Bocoup has been creating, championing, and continually improving open tools and workflows used around the world. We foster environments of inclusivity and individuality as we dedicate ourselves to solving global market challenges in the public sphere. We bring diverse experience and leadership to all of our projects so developers and users can accomplish more.</p>
